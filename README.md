# Furry ReHome App

This is a JavaScript and Rails application that is used to re-home pets, the decision of the project came from seeing lots of people trying to re-home their pet for any reasons, this way users can view the certain pets they want to adopt or re-home.

This app does not have a function to adopt yet, but it will be extended when I have more time to get back to it.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone the repository

* Run `bundle install`
* `cd` into the `backened` folder and run `rails s` to start the server
* open another tab in terminal and `cd` into `frontend` folder and run `open index.html`.

## Image Attributions

None of the image in the project are from internet.
- Cats picture from my cousin, Karen Lee.
- I owned the rest of the pictures.
- And yes, I sketched out my own "No Image Available"

## Looking To Add Later
* PostgreSQL
* Heroku

Since I had system problem with postgreSQL, so I used SQLite for my project. So once I get that figured out, the instruction will be change.
